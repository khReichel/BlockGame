This was built using Visual Studio 2010 as a MFC application

The object of the game is to remove all the blocks from the screen.

When clicking on a block the game checks to see if any of the adjacent blocks have the same color as the current one. If it does then
it removes all the blocks are removed and the board is compacted down and to the left.

When there are no other moves available, or all the blocks are gone, the game ends and pops up a message dialog box to tell you
the game is over.
